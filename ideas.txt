Rust Invaders Ideas

Scoring system. e.g. x times multiplier for 10 x enemies killed since last being hit.

UI for game start and end / restart.
Show highest scores scoreboard.

Firing sounds, hit/death sounds, background music

Space backdrop.

Immunity time after spawning. Done

Display current/available hp.

Enemy variation, sprites, formation, projectile type (spinning laser e.g.), speed, damage, kill value, chance of dropping pickups.
	
	formations: circle, fibbonacci, y=x, y=x^2
	Need enemy state struct attached to each enemy? 

Player heavy fire. Hold space to charge up more powerful attacks. Just pressing gives same fire as currently.

Pickups. + hp, + attack speed, + attack damage, - sprite size, + movement speed, single use shield (think vaunt like ability) 

Outside of game progression. 

Reduce amount of randomised behaviour?
